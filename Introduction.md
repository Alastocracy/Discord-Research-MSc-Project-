**Background**

Discord is a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), instant messaging and digital distribution application that originally released in 2015 as a new VoIP alternative for gamers. Over the past 6 years it has surpassed its predecessors in Skype, Raidcall, Ventrillo and Teamspeak as the most used communication service for gaming today. While it has taken over the gaming scene it has also become a platform for a wide variety of different communities from Anime to Education.

Discord allows voice calls and direct messages, but what makes it stand out the most is its ‘servers’. A user can create and personalise a server, and then invite other users to it. Once set up the owner can add text channels for users to type in, share media and have discussions; and also voice channels for users to join and talk to each other. These servers are what really push Discord from being a platform for gaming into a platform for communities of all shapes and sizes. There is a high level of customization for server owners, with the ability to create a role hierarchy for members and restrict access to different channels in a server. The scope and possibility for Discord servers is very wide, and they can provide an online home for all kinds of groups and communities. Over the past year while many people have been in isolation due to Corona virus and Discord has been used to organise social activities online. The image below shows what the inside of a Discord server looks like and how servers are constructed, with channels grouped together and labelled for different topics. There is a list of voice and text channels to choose from on the left, with whichever channel you have open in the centre, and the member list on the right-hand side:

However, these servers with their restricted access, customisability and anonymity of the users and owners leave room for misuse and exploitation. In April 2021 Discord released their transparency report for July-December 2020 along with some shocking statistics. Numbers for user reports, account deletions and server deletions had increased dramatically from the first half of the year. In particular 27,410 servers were deleted with the most common reasons being Cybercrime, Exploitative Content, Harassment, Spam, Cheats and Extremism. Bear in mind that these are the purposes of the servers themselves, and not isolated incidents within them.

While the rapid increases in number of these cases is recent, the types of cases and incidents are not. As the platform has grown these issues have only become more and more prominent, and with that in mind there is very little academic research done on Discord. While their transparency report highlights their own side of dealing with these problems and the progress they are making to prevent them from occurring, this report investigates the experience of users on the platform and their safety, security and privacy.

**Research Aims**

The key points for this research to investigate were user concerns and trends about privacy, safety and security. Awareness and use of the available privacy and safety options, their safety concerns on the platform, whether they keep up to date with issues and developments, and their experience on the platform around these areas. The intended participants are adult Discord users, ranging from occasional to everyday use of the platform. At the end of the research the hope was to be able to draw conclusions from the data about user trends, awareness and engagement with the different features of Discord and identify potential patterns between how they use the platform and their user experience.
